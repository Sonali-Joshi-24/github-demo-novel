Summary on git commit
The git commit command is one of the core primary functions of Git.
Prior use of the git add command is required to select the changes
that will be staged for the next commit. Then git commit is used to
create a snapshot of the staged changes along a timeline of a Git 
projects history. Learn more about git add usage on the accompanying
 page. The git status command can be used to explore the state of the 
 staging area and pending commit.
